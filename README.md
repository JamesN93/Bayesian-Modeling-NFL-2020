An analytical and predictive Bayesian model to predict chance of winning championship in NFL 2020 season.
Based on game scores of 10 NFL seasons (2010-2019), I used Bayesian statistics, namely Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, to create a model on game scores and predict championship chance for each of 32 NFL teams.
The model predicts New England Patriots to be the team with best chance of becoming NFL 2020 champion with 17% chance!
